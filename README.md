My name is Julio Dondisch, Iâ€™m a freshman engineering student at Texas A&M, and hope to start my computer science major next year.

I have about 3 years of java programming experience, both from school coursework and personal projects of interest. 

My computer science interests include information theory, machine learning, and the application of these into the medical and consumer markets. I also have interests in chemistry, physics, mathematics, and neuroscience, and believe that machine learning has the potential to play a crucial role in helping humans maintain healthy and happy lifestyles.

I've stored most of my work in this github repository
